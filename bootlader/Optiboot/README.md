Optiboot is an easy to install upgrade to the Arduino bootloader within Arduino boards. It provides the following features:

Allows larger sketches. Optiboot is only 512 bytes, freeing 1.5k of extra code space compared to older bootloaders.
Makes your sketches upload faster. Optiboot operates at higher baud rates and has streamlined programming.
Adaboot performance improvements. Optiboot implements "fastboot" that starts sketches immediate after power-on.
Compatible with ATmega8, ATmega168, and ATmega328p Arduinos and derivatives including Lilypad, Pro, Nano, and many derivatives.
Works with MANY additional Atmel AVR chips - almost anything that supports bootloads or "flash self-programming." This includes chips from ATtiny 8pin chips through the 100pin ATmega2560 used on Arduino Mega.
Supports alternate serial ports, CPU frequencies and baud rates.
